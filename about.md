        <p>
        Ever since Chris was a little boy, he loved computers and his dream was to program
        computer games.  He even spent some time with the Doom Level Editor.  Some time later,
        Chris met another university student named Ada.  Discussions of their future together
        included Chris possibly playing computer games as a career.  This was (quickly) replaced
        with the more acceptable possibility of Chris creating computer games and selling them
        for some much needed money.
        </p>
        <p>
        One day when out on a walk they came upon an abandoned mocha shack with a 'For Lease'
        sign.  Hmmm.  Ada agreed Chris could start up his computer game company IF he promised
        to eat all his vegetables, and IF it would make him happy to express himself in creative
        ways and IF he could do it on his own time and IF whatever programmers he hired would stay
        out of sight in the mocha shack.  More time passed, and their carefree lifestyle was
        replaced with responsibility and reality.  This left Saturday mornings for daydreaming
        and playing the occasional video game.  More time passed and their lifestyle was further replaced
        with a mortgage (which included a basement and behemoth garden) and adorable daughter.
        The trade-off was well worth it, but Chris's dreams lingered on.
        </p>
        <p>
        Disenchanted with their day jobs, Chris
        and Ada both agreed it was time to pursue Saturday Morning Productions once more.  By
        then, the mocha shack was long gone and Chris's ideas of computer games matured to be
        functional computer applications, which wasn't a bad thing.
        In February 2009, they toasted to a new lease on life and thus began their adventure
        in basement-based software development.
