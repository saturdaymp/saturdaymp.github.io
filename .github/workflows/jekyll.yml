# Sample workflow for building and deploying a Jekyll site to GitHub Pages

  # Runs on pushes targeting the default branch
  push:

  # Runs when a YouTube videos update PR is merged

# Allow only one concurrent deployment, cancelling in-progress runs in favour of the latest queued.
# Both push and pull_request triggers can fire for the same merge; cancel-in-progress avoids duplicates.
